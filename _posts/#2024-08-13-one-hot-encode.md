One-hot encoding is a method to represent categorical variables numerically. Each category gets its own binary variable: 1 if the observation belongs to that category, 0 otherwise.

Computers only understand numbers, so categorical information needs to be converted.

- Avoids implicit ordering that happens if you use integers (0, 1, 2â€¦) for categories.
- Prevents multicollinearity when done properly, because each variable is orthogonal to the others (if you leave out the reference category).
