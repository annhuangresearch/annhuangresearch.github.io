# Materials and Equipment

* **BITalino Core BT (MCU+BT+PWR):** The main board that enables real-time data streaming. Details can be found [here], including a diagram of the functional blocks and components.  
* **1500 mAh 3.7 V battery**  
* **EMG sensors:** Built specifically for measuring muscle activity  
* **BITalino sensor cable (100 cm):** Connects the EMG sensors to the main board  
* **3-lead electrode cable:** Connects the EMG sensors to the electrodes  
* **Disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes\*:** Standard pre-gelled, self-adhesive disposable electrodes  
* **3D-printed casings:** Protect the circuit board and sensors for durability  

\*The number of electrodes varies depending on your needs.

# Get started with using BITalino for physiological measurements

Before recording signals, please review the BITalino Quickstart Guide.

## Step 1. Install the software  
Download the OpenSignals software from this [link]. For more details, see the [OpenSignals datasheet].

## Step 2. Connect the battery  
Attach the 3.7 V battery to the main board and switch on the power.

## Step 3. Establish bluetooth connection  
Open the OpenSignals software and connect your computer to the main board via Bluetooth.  
Enter the password **1234** when prompted (see p. 18 of the [user manual]).  
Click the GUI symbol at the bottom to “Find and configure your devices.”

[user manual]: https://opensignals.net/opensignals_(r)evolution_user_manual-print.pdf  

## Step 4. Select channels  
The main board has six available channels (see the back of the board). Select **the number and type of channels** you want to use (e.g., A1 & A2 for EMG), and disable the others by deselecting the blue dots.  
*Note: a blue dot means the channel is already active—no need to click “Enable” again.*

## Step 5. Configure file saving  
Click the GUI symbol at the bottom to “Change OpenSignals settings.” Here you can:  
* Choose the file format (.txt, .h5, .edf). A .txt file is sufficient for processing in Python or MATLAB.  
* Specify the save location for your recordings.  

For details, see the [file formats description].

## Step 6. Connect electrodes  
Assemble the setup by connecting:  
* Sensor cable → EMG sensor  
* EMG sensor → 3-lead electrode cable  

Ensure the channel number matches the sensor selected in Step 4.  

**Important:** The EMG sensor has two sets of outputs:  
* The socket labeled **A1, AVCC, REF, GND** connects to the main board.  
* The socket labeled **IN-, REF, IN+** (marked “EMG” on the side) connects to the 3-lead electrode cable.  

If connected incorrectly, the bipolar recording system will not work.

## Step 7. Place the electrodes
Attach the gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes to the 3-lead cable and place them on the target muscle.  
The middle electrode serves as the reference/ground.

## Step 8. Record data  
Click the red **Record** button to start acquisition.  
When finished, click “Start the file viewer on the current file” to review your recording.  

You can also watch this [video] for a demonstration of OpenSignals features, including generating reports.

The data are now saved in your chosen location and ready for processing.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

**Bluetooth connection issues:**  
Sometimes a Bluetooth error may occur. If this happens:  
1. Turn Bluetooth off and back on, or delete the existing BITalino connection from your computer.  
2. Reconnect by entering the PIN again.  

See p. 185 of the [user manual] for a full error list, or refer to the dedicated Bluetooth troubleshooting guide.
