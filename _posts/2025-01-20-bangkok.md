## Trip to Thailand

Bangkok was wonderful. Excellent, warm 30 deg. C weather, friendly people, and great cuisine.

Day 1 we arrived at Grande Centre Point hotel at night, and ordered room service since it was too late to go out for late snack & dinner. The coconut water was refreshing and the Pad Thai was delicious.
