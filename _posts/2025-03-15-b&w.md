Recently I've been playing around with this black & white film recipe. I like that shooting in black and white can really "highlight" your subjects thus telling a more interesting and focused story. I also love the clean, modern look from this recipe. Here are some sample photos. All photos are straight out of the camera (SOOC) without any editing.
