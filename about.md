Ann Huang is a researcher trained in the PhD Research Training Group [Computational Cognition](https://cognition.uni-osnabrueck.de/research/) in the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/fb8/en/ikw) at the University Osnabr√ºck. Previously she was a research assistant in the [Institute of Informatics](https://www.en.um.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at LMU Munich. Ann's work intersects computational cognitive science and human-computer interaction, with a focus on understanding dyadic perception and biases in decision-making.

Using methods from experimental psychology, statistical modeling, augmented and virtual reality, Ann explores how principles of embodied social cognition can inform the design of machines or technology interfaces that make human-computer interaction more natural and intuitive.
