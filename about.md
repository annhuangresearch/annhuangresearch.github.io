Ann Huang a scientific researcher trained in the PhD Research Training Group [Computational Cognition](https://cognition.uni-osnabrueck.de/research/) in the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/fb8/ikw") at the University Osnabr√ºck. Previously she was a research assistant in the [Institute of Informatics](https://www.en.um.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at LMU Munich. Ann's work intersects embodied social cognition and human-computer interaction, with a focus on understanding dyadic perception and decision-making.

Using methods from experimental psychology, statistical modeling, augmented and virtual reality, she explores how principles of embodied cognition can inform the design of machines and interfaces that make human-computer interaction more natural and intuitive.
